Firstly, I apologize for using a pre-recorded presentation due to my sore throat. Please bear with me. I will now explain the current progress and future plans. The leftmost column repre_sents the items being executed, the "now" column indicates the com_pleted progress, and the "future" column repre_sents the planned but not yet com_pleted progress.

Re_garding simulated trading, we have completed simulated trading for both the U.S. stock market and the Taiwan stock market. There's still a sig_ni_(fe)fi_cant amount of testing and optimization left to do. In terms of classi_fi_cation, we have completed the stock classi_fi_cation for Taiwan, but we haven't found a classification method for the U.S. stock market yet. For stock events, we haven't started working on that yet, but it's included in our future plans. In terms of parameters, we tested the model parameters pro_vided by CCU but haven't i_denti_fied the best parameters yet. For the GUI part, we are able to display simulated results for the Taiwan stock market, but we haven't (int)inte_grated the U.S. stock market into the website yet. For GUI interaction, we plan to allow you to modify parameters online and send calculation requests to the server.

Lastly, in our future plans, the items in red represent the ten(t)ta_(teaf)tive execution sequence.
