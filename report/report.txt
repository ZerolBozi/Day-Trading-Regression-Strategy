I will show you the main points of the paper, the paper name is called em_piri_cal (a)e_valuations on momentum effects of Taiwan

The (a)e_(fi)ffi_(shent)cient - Market Hy_pothe_sis suggests that predicting market moves is tough due to quick reactions to new information.
However, some strategies, like momentum strategy, seem profitable in practice.
We explored this in Taiwan's stock market using real data. Testing four strategies on TAIEX Futures from Jan 2010 to Mar 2015, we found market in_(n)e_ffi_ciencies.
Different stop loss and take profit methods confirmed the momentum effect. Managing these approa_ches is cru_(show)cial for strategy success, imporving trading quality beyond just tech_nical details.

The paper give us two types of trading strategies
first, mean rever_sion strategy
the second one is momentum strategy.
this paper focuses on the second type of strategy and employs the the following four types of day trading strategies
first one is base momentum strategy
and second one is add the stop loss in the strategy
third one is add the take profit
last strategy is to use stop loss and take profit

How to trade?
When the stock price breaks the set thres_hold price within the trading day, we take long or short positions and close them at the end of the market trading time

Here is the For_mu_la used in the paper

The testing is done in groups of 100 trades each, calculating the sta_tis_tical data for each group.

The test results showed that momentum strategies are effec_tive in Taiwan's index futures market. Additionally, using stop-loss instead of take-profit led to higher profits, highlighting the momentum effect in the market.

This chart com_pares the four types of strategies.
You can see that the stop loss strategy is the most effec_tive.

This is how the paper find the best parameters

The most (stay)sta_ble profit can be assessed using two performance indi_cators
the TP/MDD ratio and the System Quality Number (SQN). The TP and MDD ratio is called MAR index, and a higher value indicates a better strategy. As TP goes up, MDD goes down, leading to a larger MAR. This indicates smaller fluc_tu_ations in (games)gains and losses and more stable profit growth.
On the other hand, the SQN is calculated as Average Profit divided Stan_dard Devi_ation of Profits mul_ti_plied S_(貴兒)quare Root of Number of Trades. If SQN more then 2, it suggests a fair_ly good trading strategy.

Conclusion
This paper explores the momentum effect in Taiwan's index futures market. Momentum strategies confirm the profit_ability in the market. Additionally, in_cor_po_rating stop-loss and take-profit methods into consider_ation veri_fies the momentum effect phenomenon in Taiwan's stock market. According to test results, the stop-loss method appears to effec_tively (in)en_hance the performance of trading strategies, while the take-profit method does not. This phenomenon is re_ferred to as the momentum effect in Taiwan's index futures.

The current code standar_(dies)dizes data formats and supports backtesting for both the US and Taiwan stock markets. In the future, it can ac_commo_date additional markets. If real trading is to be im_ple_mented, pathways for real trading have also been prepared.

You can adjust parameter values based on the items shown in the following images and use the method pro_vided in the paper to find the opti_mal parameter solution.
